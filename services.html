					<p>People routinely use the Internet to review services from plumbers to hairdressers. Now the tables are turned. Companies are rating their customers, casting into darkness those who do not make the grade.</p>
					<p>Hussein Kanji insists he is not a bad Uber passenger.</p>
					<p>“I’ve asked drivers to turn up or down heat, to not play music loudly, or to roll up windows,” the London venture capitalist said. “I can’t imagine why they would lower my passenger score.”</p>
					<p>They apparently did. The wait for a ride suddenly became interminable. “For about three weeks, Uber was basically unusable,” Mr. Kanji said.</p>

					<p>As Uber has grown to become one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, its ambitions often seem limitless.</p>
					<p>But of all the ways that Uber could change the world, the most far-reaching may be found closest at hand: your office. Uber, and more broadly the app-driven labor market it represents, is at the center of what could be a sea change in work, and in how people think about their jobs. You may not be contemplating becoming an Uber driver any time soon, but the Uberization of work may soon be coming to your chosen profession.</p>
					<p>Just as Uber is doing for taxis, new technologies have the potential to chop up a broad array of traditional jobs into discrete tasks that can be assigned to people just when they’re needed, with wages set by a dynamic measurement of supply and demand, and every worker’s performance constantly tracked, reviewed and subject to the sometimes harsh light of customer satisfaction. Uber and its ride-sharing competitors, including Lyft and Sidecar, are the boldest examples of this breed, which many in the tech industry see as a new kind of start-up — one whose primary mission is to efficiently allocate human beings and their possessions, rather than information.</p>

					<p>Thomas Healy does not have tickets to the Super Bowl, but he plans to fly to Phoenix with something that is even harder to come by than seats at Sunday’s game: the first detailed, experimental data on how atmospheric conditions might have reduced the air pressure in footballs used by the New England Patriots in their victory over the Indianapolis Colts nearly two weeks ago.</p>
					<p>Those footballs, which the N.F.L. has said were deflated to pressures below league standards, have created a national meta-bowl whose outcome is seemingly as important as who wins on Sunday. The question driving the public dialogue is whether the Patriots tampered with the balls to make them easier to handle, or whether simply moving them from the warmth of a locker room to the chill and dampness of the field could account for the deflation.</p>

					<p>There is a man in South Dakota who, on occasion, will stump people with a trivia question: Can you name the original starting quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks?</p>
					<p>The answer is not Jim Zorn. Neither is the man.</p>
					<p>Neil Graff is 65 now, and has been a financial adviser in Sioux Falls for more than 35 years. But he has a unique tie to the Seahawks and the New England Patriots, the two franchises playing in Sunday’s Super Bowl.</p>
